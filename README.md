# Customized PlantUML for Speedy workflow.

I prefer to use [C4 Architecture model](https://c4model.com/) for defining Software architecture.  PlantUML have standard library to support C4 model. 
But my turn around time is not great.  So, decided to create this repo to define repeatedly used colors, tags, Skin params, code snippet, etc., 

## Todos

- [ ] Define some carefully picked color palette for smooth UI.  
- [ ] Add code snippet for defining Tags, Relations, etc.,  
- [ ] Add code snippet to select required icon in sprites.  
- [ ] Add Skin params for Class diagram & Sequence diagram to match with predefined color palette.
- [ ] Define repeatedly used elements.
